# WordPrediction
## Description
This project displays the three most probable word completions as the user is typing. The list of suggestions is updated with each keystroke. 

## How to Use
If one of the suggestions is the word that you wish to type, you can autocomplete the word by choosing the arrow key that pertains to your word choice. 
To autofill the first word, choose the '<' arrow key.  
To autofill the second word, choose the '^' arrow key.
To autofill the third word, choose the '>' arrow key.

## Run the Program
Run the program with Python 2.7: ```python main.py```

Once executed, you will be prompted with more detailed instructions on how to use the word predictor. Once you hit the "Enter" key, the program will take a second to train on the trigrams/bigrams and you will be able to type words into the word predictor.
