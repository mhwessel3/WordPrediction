# WordPrediction

Run the program with Python 2.7: ```python main.py```

Once executed, you will be prompted with a cool giraffe that gives you instructions on how to use the word predictor. Once you hit the "Enter" key, the program will take a second to train on the trigrams/bigrams and you will be able to type words into the word predictor.
